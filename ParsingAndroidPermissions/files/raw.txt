READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
Added in API level 16

public static final String READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
Allows an application to read from external storage.

Note: Starting in API level 33, this permission has no effect. If your app accesses other apps' media files, request one or more of these permissions instead: READ_MEDIA_IMAGES, READ_MEDIA_VIDEO, READ_MEDIA_AUDIO. Learn more about the storage permissions that are associated with media files.

This permission is enforced starting in API level 19. Before API level 19, this permission is not enforced and all apps still have access to read from external storage. You can test your app with the permission enforced by enabling Protect USB storage under Developer options in the Settings app on a device running Android 4.1 or higher.

Also starting in API level 19, this permission is not required to read or write files in your application-specific directories returned by Context.getExternalFilesDir(String) and Context.getExternalCacheDir().

Starting in API level 29, apps don't need to request this permission to access files in their app-specific directory on external storage, or their own files in the MediaStore. Apps shouldn't request this permission unless they need to access other apps' files in the MediaStore. Read more about these changes in the scoped storage section of the developer documentation.

If both your minSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion values are set to 3 or lower, the system implicitly grants your app this permission. If you don't need this permission, be sure your targetSdkVersion is 4 or higher.

This is a soft restricted permission which cannot be held by an app it its full form until the installer on record allowlists the permission. Specifically, if the permission is allowlisted the holder app can access external storage and the visual and aural media collections while if the permission is not allowlisted the holder app can only access to the visual and aural medial collections. Also the permission is immutably restricted meaning that the allowlist state can be specified only at install time and cannot change until the app is installed. For more details see PackageInstaller.SessionParams.setWhitelistedRestrictedPermissions(Set).

Allows an application to receive the Intent.ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED that is broadcast after the system finishes booting. If you don't request this permission, you will not receive the broadcast at that time. Though holding this permission does not have any security implications, it can have a negative impact on the user experience by increasing the amount of time it takes the system to start and allowing applications to have themselves running without the user being aware of them. As such, you must explicitly declare your use of this facility to make that visible to the user.

Added in API level 28

public static final String USE_BIOMETRIC
Allows an app to use device supported biometric modalities.

Protection level: normal

Constant Value: "android.permission.USE_BIOMETRIC"

USE_EXACT_ALARM
Added in API level 33

public static final String USE_EXACT_ALARM
Allows apps to use exact alarms just like with SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM but without needing to request this permission from the user.

This is only intended for use by apps that rely on exact alarms for their core functionality. You should continue using SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM if your app needs exact alarms for a secondary feature that users may or may not use within your app.

Keep in mind that this is a powerful permission and app stores may enforce policies to audit and review the use of this permission. Such audits may involve removal from the app store if the app is found to be misusing this permission.

Apps need to target API Build.VERSION_CODES.TIRAMISU or above to be able to request this permission. Note that only one of USE_EXACT_ALARM or SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM should be requested on a device. If your app is already using SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM on older SDKs but need USE_EXACT_ALARM on SDK 33 and above, then SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM should be declared with a max-sdk attribute, like:


 <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM"
 	 android:maxSdkVersion="32" />
 
Apps that hold this permission, always stay in the WORKING_SET or lower standby bucket.

Constant Value: "android.permission.USE_EXACT_ALARM"
